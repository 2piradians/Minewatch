This mod alters fundamental parts of the Minecraft game; parts of Minecraft may not work with this mod installed. All damages caused from the use or misuse of this mod fall on the user.

2. USE

3. REDISTRIBUTION
This mod may not be uploaded or mirrored by anyone other than the owner, and all links to this mod must directly link to Curse or CurseForge and not through a third party link site. Any unauthorized mirrors of or links to the mod that bypass this will be discovered and forced to be deleted.

4. DERIVATIVE WORKS
This mod is provided freely and may be decompiled and modified for private use, either with a decompiler or a bytecode editor. Public use of modified or derivative versions is prohibited unless you are given specific written permission. Distribution of the source code, modified (including custom compilation) or otherwise, is prohibited by anyone except the author, except in the case of a derivative mod that has been given prior approval. Creating derivative works for commercial use is expressly forbidden and the owner reserves full right to seek damages.

5. ADDONS AND MODIFICATIONS
Addons and modifications that use none of my mods' source can be made and released freely and distributed as the creator sees fit. However, if I feel an addon or modification's sole purpose is to damage one of my mods - such as by hurting its compatibility with other mods, breaking features, damaging the balance or fundamentally damaging how it was designed - I reserve the right to revoke this permission and prevent it from being used in conjunction with my mods.

6. MONETIZATION
Any attempts to make money off of this mod (selling, selling modified/derivative versions, adfly, sharecash, donations, ad revenue, etc.) are strictly forbidden, and the owner may claim damages or take other action to rectify the situation. Servers hosting the pack may take donations to cover operating costs, but not for personal profit. Additionally, the mods' behaviors may not be edited - such as by making some items unobtainable - to encourage or coerce players to pay or donate to the pack or server host. These actions are also expressly forbidden by the MC terms of use.

You must agree to the entirety of this license in full in order to use the mods or include it in a pack. Use of the mods constitutes implicit and unconditional agreement to these terms.
The author of this mod reserves the right to change this license as is deemed necessary without prior warning, though such warning may and likely will be provided at the author's discretion. Such changes take effect immediately; it is not required to explicitly agree nor update the mods.

8. COST
